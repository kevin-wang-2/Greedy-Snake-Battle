                        <h3><b>Game Description</b></h3>
                        <p>Greedy snake is a well-known computer game, and the lab prepares a modified version of greedy
                            snake that can enable two AI players to compete within a battle field.
                            The AIs will battle in a 50-by-50 field, and take move one by one. Before one AI makes a
                            move, the system will check if it crashes itself, other snake or is out of boundary.
                            If these circumstances happened the snake loses the game and the opponent wins. If none of
                            the two snakes fail within 2000 rounds, the game will end and the player with longer snake
                            wins.</p>
                        <h3><b>Interface and Usage</b></h3>
                        <p>Greedy Snake Lab has provided you with a functional interface, including a bug-free vector
                            class, and a standard main function used in the OJ server. To finish this lab, you need to
                            implement the game_t class and finish judge function to decide your own move. The
                            implementations should be written in a file called lab8.cpp and should be uploaded to the OJ
                            server
                            in text form.</p>
                        <p>The standard vector class includes the necessary arithmetic operations, standard
                            constructors, and related functions including vector normalize and length function.
                            The snakes are stored in the form of a STL vector containing our vector2D instance to
                            present each position it has taken on the chessboard. Direction is an enum class, which
                            contains UP, DOWN, LEFT and RIGHT elements.</p>
                        <p>The related files could be downloaded from canvas.</p>
                        <h3><b>Debugging</b></h3>
                        <p>The given main.cpp contains a basic main function but it's not human-friendly. If you want to
                            debug your program, you could create your own main.cpp and test your game_t class with that
                            main function because your game_t class
                            is supposed to be correct with any valid implementation of main.cpp.</p>
                        <p>Do not submit malicious codes or try to hack the server using any methods. If you do so, you
                            will have a large deduction in this lab.</p>
                        <h3><b>Due Date</b></h3>
                        <p>Submission of this lab will continue until 12/13 11:59pm, then all the score will be restored
                            and formal competition will start.</p>
                        <h3><b>Specifications</b></h3>
                        <ul style="list-style-type: decimal">
                            <li>
                                To present the snakes in a chessboard, we note the top-left grid as the grid 0-0, whose
                                corresponding vector is (0, 0). The x value increases in from left to right and the y
                                value increases from top to bottom.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                If a program has any runtime errors or has accidentally exited if neither of the players
                                has been lost, this player automatically loses and his opponent automatically wins.

                                operation within 1 second, he automatically loses and his opponent automatically wins.
